        "Showing that there is only a 1/18 chance of giving up possession because we voluntarily elected *not* to get the 1st down. The calculus is now very easy. Going back to our original decision, if we decide to stretch out and get the first down then we will be 1 yard further ahead than if we stop at 9 yards. On the other hand, if we stop and play 2nd and 1 and then make at least one rushing play (or two if needed) we will, with roughly 94% chance, advance 4.9 yards to a 1st down which will be 3.9 yards on average further down the field. So the only question is, would you accept a 6% chance of losing possession (assuming punt) in exchange for 4 yards? Remember that this isn't a 4th and 1 situation. We will be punting regardless. And we'll assume that we are midfield somewhere expecting a net punt of a little over 40 yards. A change of possession is probably going to cost us a tad over 2 points. We can think of a loss of possession directly in yards, in fact. So let's call it 40 yards. \n",

        "In order for that last yard stretch to be a good idea, you need the value of a possession to correspond to roughly 17 multiplied by the average yards gained minus one. In other words, you need possession to be valued at roughly 66.3 yards. There is no way that's true, even if you have the best Australian rules punter on your team. \n",
